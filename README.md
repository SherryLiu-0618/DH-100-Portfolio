# Bio

I am an undergraduate student at UC Berkeley, majoring in Statistics and minoring in Data Science. I am also interested in astronomy/astrophysics, cognitive science, and chemistry. I conducted research and analysis in the field of tennis because I always enjoy watching tennis matches and surely a fan of many of the tennis players. This project offers an in-depth perspective on how each tennis player performs over the course of history.

# Project Description

Tennis, being an Olympic sport played at all levels of society and all ages, although not as popular as football and basketball, has always been favored by many people. 

Since the 1890s the rules and forms of tennis tournaments have nearly remained unchanged, yet generation after generation of tennis players has been put onto the stage and competed fiercely with each other, replacing the old generations with the new ones. 

This project aims to find out the Greatest Players of All Times through a detailed and comprehensive data analysis. Is the most renowned player necessarily the best player in history? Are there any players with great performance but were not noticed by anyone? Aside from pure statistical analysis, the popularity of the player and comments from others will also be taken into account. 

# Tools and Methods

R: used for data cleaning, data manipulation, and data visualizing packages used in R: readr, dplyr, ggplot2, wordcloud2 

Python: used for data manipulation and data visualizing packages used in Python: pandas, matplotlib 

I used R to clean the data and conduct exploratory data analysis, the outcomes of which are shown below. I first imported the data, added information about the birth dates of some players to the dataset, and got the ages of winning the grand slam of each player. Then, I started doing exploratory data analysis. 

I explored the data from five aspects: the number of grand slams won by each player, the number of grand slams won in each year, the distribution of player's grand slam data, the number of times each player won the grand slam or was the runner-up and the grand slam distributions of the four most famous tennis players. I reached some conclusions for each of the analyses, but I got rid of the less important and less attractive ones. The ones that I deemed to be worth mentioning have been displayed below.
